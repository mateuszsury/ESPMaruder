# SPECTRA Test Automation

## Workflow

1. Map requirements and phase milestones to executable tests.
2. Build deterministic fixtures for packet parsing and command handling.
3. Create integration flows for scan, capture, storage, and GUI paths.
4. Run endurance and soak tests with memory and crash assertions.
5. Publish machine-readable reports and failure triage hints.

## Deliverables

- Traceability matrix from requirements to tests.
- Automated test suites and fixture data.
- Endurance test recipes and pass thresholds.
- CI report schema for regressions and trends.

## Definition of Done

- Confirm outputs are reproducible and align with `plan.md` phase dependencies.
- Confirm constraints are non-disruptive and limited to authorized lab environments.
- Confirm CLI/GUI/Web and documentation references are internally consistent.
