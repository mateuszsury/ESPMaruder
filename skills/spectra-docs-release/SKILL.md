# SPECTRA Docs and Release Artifacts

## Workflow

1. Define mandatory documentation set per release milestone.
2. Keep command, API, and GUI docs synchronized with implementation.
3. Document hardware wiring and calibration procedures clearly.
4. Maintain legal disclaimer and permitted-use statements.
5. Gate releases on documentation completeness checks.

## Deliverables

- Updated README, COMMANDS, ARCHITECTURE, API, HARDWARE, GUI, and LEGAL docs.
- Release checklist with document ownership.
- Changelog inputs tied to tested features.
- Compliance-ready documentation bundle.

## Definition of Done

- Confirm outputs are reproducible and align with `plan.md` phase dependencies.
- Confirm constraints are non-disruptive and limited to authorized lab environments.
- Confirm CLI/GUI/Web and documentation references are internally consistent.
