# SPECTRA Cross Protocol Analysis

## Workflow

1. Define unified event timeline and clock synchronization strategy.
2. Normalize radio-specific metrics into shared correlation schema.
3. Detect coexistence anomalies and channel contention patterns.
4. Produce cross-protocol summaries for GUI and web dashboard.
5. Keep analysis passive and evidence-based, not action-triggering.

## Deliverables

- Cross-radio event schema.
- Correlation jobs and anomaly rules.
- Coexistence health report format.
- Matter discovery analytics hooks.

## Definition of Done

- Confirm outputs are reproducible and align with `plan.md` phase dependencies.
- Confirm constraints are non-disruptive and limited to authorized lab environments.
- Confirm CLI/GUI/Web and documentation references are internally consistent.
