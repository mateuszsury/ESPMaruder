# radio_wifi

Phase 2.1 baseline status:

- Implemented: `wifi_engine` initialization/deinitialization and basic runtime controls.
- Implemented: `wifi_scanner` AP scan API with RSSI sort and PSRAM-first result allocation.

Notes:

- Current scope is passive observability only.
- Station scan, channel occupancy scan, and promiscuous sniffer are planned in next steps.
